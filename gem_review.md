Please help with the following, based on the dependency changes above:

1. **Fix failing CI/CD workflows** caused by these dependency upgrades.
   - Identify where these gems are used in the codebase.
   - Update or add code to keep existing behavior working for current versions.
   - For any version-specific changes (new APIs, callbacks, controller changes, configs):
     - Implement the necessary code updates.
     - Add comments explaining what changed in the upgraded dependency version.
     - Link to the relevant changelog entries.

2. **Changelog and docs updates**:
   - Update or create `docs/dependency-upgrades-changelog.md` (or similar) describing:
     - Which dependencies changed and why.
     - What code paths or features were updated.
     - Any behavioral differences users or developers should know about.

3. **Dependency pattern review**:
   - Check that any version-conditional code follows our `dependency_upgraded_next` pattern.

4. **PR handling**:
   - Open a draft PR with these changes first, then later mark it 'ready for review'.
   - Ensure all CI checks pass before marking the PR ready.
